## Reflection

The stack used here is: Node.js, Javascript, EJS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Express

The greatest takeaways I got from building this project were:

- Understanding API calls, and how to make request to an external server

- Understanding JSON format and how to work with and parse it

- Connecting front-end and back-end in order to display server data to the user
